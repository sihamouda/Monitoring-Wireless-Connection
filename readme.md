# Monitoring Wireless Connection Dashboard

This was a class project where we are supposed to write some simple python modules that looks for the best access point, connect to AP and view some stats

All modules works perfectly for Linux

The Dashboard was made from Flask using Socket.io (websocket) to send data from the Back-End to the Web Interface

It's my first time to use Flask and Socket.io

Note: the Interface only shows the available AP with some details
